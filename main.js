*   // The first challenge was a little easy for my liking, however I felt it would be better to keep it, rather than delete it.
*
*   // Challenge 1 - Easy
*   
*   Leap Years!
*
*   A leap year occurs every 4 years. Or do they? According to the Gregorian calendar, they occur ALMOST every 4 years.
*
*   // The conditions include //
*
*   - That the year MUST be a multiple of 4
*   - It is NOT a multiple of 100
*   - UNLESS it is a multiple of 400
*
*   Given a number of days as an input, please return true if the year provided is a leap year, or false if it is not.
*   Remember to factor in the above criteria 
*
*
*   // Challenge 2 - Medium
*
*   Incorrect Product Codes!
*   
*   Due to a fault in our database, some of our product codes have been entered incorrectly and are affecting our stock levels.
*   We need to write a function that will check the product code and return true if it is correct, or false if it is not.
